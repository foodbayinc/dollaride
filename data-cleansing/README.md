# Data Cleansing Project - n8n Workflow Automation

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive project documentation for implementing a **data cleansing workflow using n8n automation**. The solution transforms NYS motor vehicle record CSV files into CRM-ready data through a 6-step automated process.

## 🔄 n8n Workflow Process

```
📁 Google Drive → 🔄 Trigger → 📊 Google Sheets → 🧹 Cleaning → 🔍 Filtering → 🚀 HubSpot → 📋 Report
```

### 6-Step Automation Process:
1. **Google Drive Monitoring**: Automatically detect new CSV files
2. **Google Sheets Upload**: Convert and upload data to spreadsheets
3. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize emails, phones, addresses, names
4. **Preset Filtering**: Apply geographic, vehicle type, and quality criteria
5. **HubSpot Integration**: Upload cleaned contacts to CRM
6. **Report Generation**: Create processing summaries and notifications
