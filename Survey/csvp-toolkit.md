Q1. Title of the  Task / Mini Project
CVSP Strategic Planning & Year 2 Implementation Toolkit
Q2. Brief Description of the Task
This project proposes developing a practical and modular tool (“toolkit”) to support strategic
decision-making for the CVSP program as it approaches its second year. The goal is to
consolidate the following key areas into a single resource, building on existing files (such as
the tracker and budget) and producing deliverables that can be presented to ESD as
concrete outputs:
Improved Financial Forecast Scenario: Monthly projections of expenses and revenues by
subsidy type (insurance and vehicle), including estimates by goal achieved.
Smart Billing Model: A dashboard indicating how much has been invoiced to ESD, how much
can be invoiced based on execution, and billable projections under diﬀerent scenarios (with
or without approved reallocation).
Year 2 Strategic Recommendations: A brief memo with proposals to increase participation,
simplify processes, and ensure greater execution and billing for the program’s second year.
Quick Market Study Ideas: Suggestions for an exploratory (desktop) analysis to help project
subsidy demand in areas or profiles where reach has been low.
Contract Amendment T emplate: A base draft with common sections to facilitate future
contract amendments, including milestones, timelines, and division of activities between
Dollaride and SecondMuse.
Q3. Is this task already approved/planned or is it a suggestion?
Suggested (new idea or improvement)
Q4. Estimated Time to Complete
1–2 months
Q5. Desired Delivery Timeline (When should this be done?)
08/25/2025
Q6. How critical is this task to current business goals?
Think about growth, revenue, product stability, delivery commitments, etc.
High (strongly aligned with current goals)
Q7. Any other notes or context to consider?
This proposal would leverage the modifications I've made to the trackers and budget,
organizing them into comprehensive, strategic, and easily presentable deliverables. It would
be a useful, billable project that incorporates SecondMuse’s feedback without duplicating
operational eﬀorts. For this toolkit, we could use Airtable or another platform, and I’m open
to any suggestions or new ideas regarding the best tool to implement it.
